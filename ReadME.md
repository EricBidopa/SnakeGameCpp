# Snake Game
A simple implementation of the classic Snake game using the SFML library in C++. 
The game consists of a snake that moves around the screen and grows 
by eating randomly generated fruits. 
The player controls the direction of the snake using the arrow keys. 
The game usually ends if the snake hits the border or its own body.

## Requirements
SFML library


### Usage
